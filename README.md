# CNN-BankLoanGranting
Bank Loan Granting Prediction using CNN
The problem stated here is making a model to predict whether a new data input is granted a bank loan or not. This project focuses on building a predictive model for determining the likelihood of a bank granting a loan to a customer, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Although CNNs are traditionally used in image processing, in this project, the CNN will be adapted for structured data, exploiting its ability to capture complex patterns in multidimensional input.
